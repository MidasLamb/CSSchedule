# CSSchedule

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for a site that generates ICS calendar files with the individual schedules of Computer Science students at KU Leuven.
This schedule can be imported in most calendar apps, such as Google calendar or iCal. English courses are taken into consideration as counterparts for their Dutch equivalents.

## Usage

To generate an ICS file, the user simply marks the courses they want to include in the list. Afterwards, the user can generate the corresponding ICS calendar by clicking the "Download ICS File" button.

As the web-application adds the selected courses to the URL of the webpage, the selected choice can easily be saved and shared with other students by simply copying the URL of the page, either by manually selecting it, or by clicking the "Copy!" button.
